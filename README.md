# Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning
Tensorflow implementation of NIPS 2017 Paper [Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6996-prototypical-networks-for-few-shot-learning.pdf).    

This code has been ported from the official implementation in PyTorch ([jakesnell/prototypical-networks](https://github.com/jakesnell/prototypical-networks)) and may be buggy.

## Usage
* Download the Omniglot dataset by executing `download_omniglot.sh`
* Use the IPython Notebook.
